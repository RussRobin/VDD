## Introduction
VDD is a dataset featuring varied scenes, camera angles and weather/light conditions of UAV images. We provide 400 pixel-level annotated images with high resolution. Images are categorized into 7 classes: Wall, Roof, Road, Water, Vehicle, Vegetation and Others. We fouc on variance in this dataset. 

**Scene variance**
Many typical scenes are included in VDD dataset: 
* Municipal residential zones, villas, school and college buildings, and hospitals
* Highways and roads, 
* Facilities like gyms cantenn and libraries
* Natural scenes: rivers, lakes and mountains
* Rural areas: villages and farm fields

**Time & Light condition variance**
The example images are taken in spring and summer, where light conditions and vegetation changes. There is also a set of photos of the same object but taken at morning and evening respectively.

**Camera angle variance**
Photos are taken with fixed camera angles: 30, 60 and 90(bird view) degrees.
