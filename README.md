# VDD: Varied Drone Dataset
This is the official repo for VDD: Varied Drone Dataset for Semantic Segmentation.



**Introduction**

VDD is a dataset featuring varied scenes, camera angles and weather/light conditions of UAV images. We provide 400 pixel-level annotated images with high resolution. Images are categorized into 7 classes: Wall, Roof, Road, Water, Vehicle, Vegetation and Others.

Open space image shown below briefly demo ‘Varied’: scene details(vary because of change of season), camera angles and light/weather conditions vary. We view this as a special way to do data augmentation. Please refer to our paper for details.



**Scene variance**

Many typical scenes are included in VDD dataset: 
* Municipal residential zones, villas, school and college buildings, and hospitals
* highways and roads, 
* Facilities like gyms cantenn and libraries
* Natural scenes: rivers, lakes and mountains
* Rural areas: villages and farm fields

**Time & Light condition variance**

The example images are taken in spring and summer, where light conditions and vegetation changes. There is also a set of photos of the same object but taken at morning and evening respectively.

**Camera angle variance**

Photos are taken with fixed camera angles: 30, 60 and 90(bird view) degrees.
